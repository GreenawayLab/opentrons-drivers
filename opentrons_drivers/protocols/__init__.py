"""Protocols module for Opentrons drivers.

Contains protocols i.e. scripts that can be executed on Opentrons hardware.
This module is designed to provide a structured way to organize and manage
protocols that can be run on Opentrons devices, such as pipetting protocols,
liquid handling protocols, and other automated laboratory procedures.

Protocols in this module should import necessary components from the
`opentrons_drivers.common` module to utilize shared utilities and constants.
