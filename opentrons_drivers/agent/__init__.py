"""Agent module for Opentrons drivers.

Contains agents i.e. scripts that listen for and execute commands on Opentrons hardware.
This module is designed to provide a structured way to organize and manage
agents that can be run on Opentrons devices as part of a closed-loop system.

Agents in this module should import necessary components from the
`opentrons_drivers.common` module to utilize shared utilities and constants.
